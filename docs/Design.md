14. Units, Great People
15. Civilians
16. Cities, territory
17. CS diplomacy modifiers
18. Time/years/turns
19. Events

## Systems brainstorming usage 🧠

- Promotions become inventory and level
- Policies become spells available per level
- Religion is refactored into virtues
- Turn counts could be leveraged for paradrop moongate travel (div/8)
- Settling might be restricted to being camps, while CS's rep cities of virtue, keeps, etc
- Cities cannot be entered, so maybe a temporary city is placed adjacent as an interface to rep being in the city, so buying supplies, etc, and other city-based actions can occur, then the city-interface razes when out

## Considered ideas

- unicode runic used with some events, etc
- Can a city or CS be founded on top of a natural wonder? If so, the wonder could be a virtue layer, for adjacency triggers
- Can a unit set itself to being captured?
- Dungeons! Can these be barbarian camps that spawn npc enemies?


## Game flow

Lessay your civ spawns, you have an Avatar. You must adventure to each city of virtue, obtain some proof. You must visit the shrines, maybe with the proofs acquired.
Perhaps needed items are available in other towns only with a trigger item onhand. This would spur travel to world locations as prereqs to advance.
